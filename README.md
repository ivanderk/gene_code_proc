# Capgemini ADCenter Network Code Challenge
## Gene Code Processing

### introduction

This is a possible solution for the first Code Challenge by the ADCenter Network from Capgemini. 
This one is written in F# and not intended to be a reference solution nor a showcase of proper "best practices".

### The challenge

A detailed description of the Challenge [can be found here](doc/ADCenter_Network_Code_Challenge_Processing_mRNA_Sequences.pdf), while the rules [are detailed here](doc/Code_Challenge_Rules_of_Engagement.pdf).

### Installation .NET

This projects needs .NET 5.0+ in order to be compiled and run successfully. You can find instructions on how to install for you platform here:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0

### Compile and run 

In the root of the solution directory the project can be build by running the command:

    dotnet build

All unit-tests can be run with:

    dotnet test

The executable can be run with

     dotnet run --project .\src\App\App.fsproj .\data\refMrna.fa.corrected.txt

Note that the sample file is _refMrna.fa.corrected.txt_ which is valid. The original file _refMrna.fa.txt_ can be used but contains (intentionally) coding errors

### Why F#

For Fun ("and Profit"?). F# is together with TypeScript and Rust my favourite programming language triplet _du-jour_. Although in case of F# that fondness has not been so short-lived. IÂ´ve liked the language a lot from when i first encountered it (2008 I think).   

Good resources to start are the [F# home page](https://fsharp.org/), the [docs at Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/)  and the phenomenally rich site [F# for Fun and Profit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/).
